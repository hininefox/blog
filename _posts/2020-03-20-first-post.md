# EDA is the approach for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques<sup>[1](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda11.htm)</sup> to  
- maximize insight into a data set
- uncover underlying structure
- extract important variables
- detect outliers and anomalies
- test underlying assumptions
- develop parsimonious models
- determine optimal factor settings  

EDA with a team was full of struggles but rewarding. It was hard to get the ball rolling without a question to focus on. However once we had a direction to play with the data, we're able to start answering questions and think about questions of our own.  

I did couple time series analyses, bar charts, and scatter plots. To show trends, frequency counts, and correlations respectively.  

I need to better understand why I am exploring because my time series analyses, in my opinion, did not generate tremendous values. Though the bar chart and the scatter plots were interesting in showing relationships between categories and quantitative variables.  

## First consider a question, then
EDA questions to think about
- What features to work with?
- What features brought interest?
- What were the features' types?
- How much of the data was missing, how was it handled?
- What were feature's relationships to each other and to the target?
