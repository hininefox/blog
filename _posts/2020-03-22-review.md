# Numpy

In data science and other scientific fields, numpy ndarray is a popular data structure used for scientific computing. By taking advantage of homogeneity and contiguous memory address, we're able to do vector and matrix computation efficiently without having to manually loop through the arrays. It's quicker compared to native Python built-ins, the code is also more readable.

Numpy also have more advance indexing system compared to python lists. On top of regular list indexing and slicing, numpy can do fancy and boolean indexing.
Lastly, numpy is able to do aggregation across different axes in a multidimensional array.
